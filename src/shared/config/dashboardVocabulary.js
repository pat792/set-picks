/**
 * Consistent user-facing terms for dashboard / game surfaces:
 *
 * - **Standings** — Short nav label (`/dashboard/standings`). Same screen as “show standings”
 *   for the date selected in the header.
 * - **Show standings** — Ordered points for one show date only (everyone or one pool).
 * - **All-time standings** — Cumulative leaderboard across every finalized show (all tours).
 *   Canonical name replacing legacy “Season totals” on pool details and optional global
 *   companion on Standings. See #148.
 * - **Tour standings** — Cumulative leaderboard scoped to the current tour via
 *   `show_calendar.showDatesByTour` (global surface on Standings; pool-scoped on pool details).
 *   See #148 / #219.
 * - **Season totals** — Legacy alias for All-time standings on pool details; kept during the
 *   transition and re-exported through {@link POOL_ALL_TIME_STANDINGS_HEADING}.
 *
 * - **Pool details** — Player-facing name for `/dashboard/pool/:id` (roster, invites, season totals).
 *   Internal code may still use “Pool Hub”; user-facing strings should say Pool details.
