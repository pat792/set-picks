# Cloud Agent Dev & Test Skill

Quick-reference for Cloud agents. Assumes a fresh VM with Node 20+ and
npm available.

## 1 — Bootstrap

```bash
npm ci                         # root deps (Vite, Vitest, ESLint, Playwright, etc.)
cd functions && npm ci && cd .. # Cloud Functions deps (firebase-admin, firebase-functions)
```

Playwright's Chromium binary is needed by `qa:cache` and `qa:chunks`.
If the runners complain about a missing browser:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Environment files

| File | Purpose | Gitignored? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `.env` | Local dev overrides (GA4, FCM VAPID key, setlist API source). Copy from `.env.example`. | Yes |
| `.env.qa.local` | QA runner fixtures (test UID, App Check debug token, test account). Copy from `.env.qa.example`. | Yes |
| `.env.staging` / `.env.production` | Vite mode files for `build:staging` / `build`. Checked in. | No |

For most implementation work, **no `.env` file is required** — the app
starts fine without one (GA4 and FCM are optional locally). If you need
to run the QA Playwright runners (`qa:cache`, `qa:chunks`), you need
`.env.qa.local` with real values (see §5).

## 2 — Dev server (Vite SPA)

```bash
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173  (strictPort: true)
```

The app is a **Vite + React 18 SPA** with React Router. It talks to
**production Firebase** (Auth, Firestore, App Check) — there is no
local emulator wiring for the web app. You can browse the landing page
and auth flows against the real backend.

### App Check debug token (localhost)

Firebase App Check blocks Firestore reads from unrecognized origins.
For `localhost:5173`, add the debug token from `docs/TESTING.md`
(`38422efd-029f-45b4-b028-7cf7fcaeeffc`) to the Firebase Console
App Check debug-token allowlist, **or** set a custom
`QA_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN` UUID and register it.

### Auth / logging in

The app uses **Firebase Auth** (email/password + Google popup).
There is no emulator-backed auth — sign-in hits the real Firebase
project. For testing:

- **Existing accounts:** Use a known test email/password (see
  `docs/TESTING.md` for the reset protocol).
- **New-user flow:** Create a throwaway account via the sign-up modal,
  then delete it from the Firebase Console afterward (Auth → Users +
  Firestore → `users` collection).

Cloud agents **cannot** complete Google OAuth popups or interact with
the Firebase Console. For headless sign-in during QA, the Playwright
runners in `scripts/qa/` sign in via the splash `/?login=true` modal
using `QA_TEST_EMAIL` / `QA_TEST_PASSWORD`.

### Feature flags / config switches

There is **no remote feature-flag service** (no LaunchDarkly, etc.).
Runtime behavior is controlled by **Vite env vars**:

| Env var | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `VITE_SETLIST_API_SOURCE` | Setlist data source; see `.env.example` for allowed values |
| `VITE_USE_CALLABLE_*_SETLIST` | `true` → route setlist fetches through a Firebase Callable |
| `VITE_SONG_CATALOG_URL` | Override CDN URL for song catalog JSON |
| `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | GA4 measurement ID; leave unset locally to avoid polluting analytics |
| `VITE_FCM_VAPID_KEY` | FCM web-push VAPID key; optional for local dev |

To "toggle a feature," set or unset these in `.env` and restart the dev
server.

## 3 — CI verify matrix (run before every push)

These four commands must all pass — they form the blocking `verify` job
in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```bash
npm run lint                    # ESLint flat config, FSD import boundaries
npm test                        # Vitest (src/**/*.test.js)
npm run verify:dashboard-meta   # Dashboard route ↔ meta consistency
npm run verify:dashboard-ui     # Banned legacy Tailwind token scan
```

`npm test` exit code **134** is a known Vitest worker-teardown flake —
re-run once before flagging.

### When to run `verify:theme-contract`

```bash
npm run verify:theme-contract   # Banned raw bg-slate-*/border-slate-* in shell/scoring files
```

Run this when touching `src/features/scoring/ui`, `src/app/layout/`, or
any file listed in `scripts/verify-theme-contract.mjs`.

## 4 — Testing by codebase area

### 4.1 Frontend unit tests (Vitest)

```bash
npm test                  # all src/**/*.test.js
npm run test:watch        # interactive watch mode
npx vitest run <pattern>  # run a subset, e.g. npx vitest run scoring
```

- Config is in `vite.config.js` → `test` block (`environment: 'node'`).
- No setup file or global mocks — tests are self-contained.
- Test files live beside their source: `src/features/*/model/*.test.js`,
  `src/shared/utils/*.test.js`, etc.

### 4.2 Cloud Functions tests

```bash
cd functions && npm test && cd ..
```

Uses Node's built-in `node --test` runner over an explicit file list in
`functions/package.json`. Tests live at `functions/*.test.js`.

### 4.3 Firestore rules tests

```bash
npm run test:rules
```

Requires **`firebase-tools`** (install globally: `npm i -g firebase-tools`)
and **Java** (the Firestore emulator is a Java process on port 8080).
Runs `firebase emulators:exec --only firestore` then
`node --test firestore.rules.test.cjs`.

Only needed when the PR touches `firestore.rules`.

### 4.4 QA Playwright runners

These run a production build through headless Chromium. Require
`.env.qa.local` (see `.env.qa.example`).

```bash
npm run build             # must produce dist/ first
npm run qa:chunks         # §A chunk-load + SPA nav verification
npm run qa:cache          # §B Firestore read cache (signs in via splash)
npm run qa:preview-headers # §C cache-control headers on deployed preview (needs QA_PREVIEW_BASE_URL)
```

If `.env.qa.local` is missing the runners exit immediately with a
pointer to the README — not a test failure. If a runner exits non-zero
with env present, treat it as a real regression.

### 4.5 Build & chunk graph

```bash
npm run build
ls -la dist/assets/*.js | awk '{printf "%10d  %s\n",$5,$NF}' | sort -nr | head -20
```

Use this to verify lazy-loading, code splitting, and `manualChunks`
behavior after touching imports or route structure. See the PR-QA skill
(`pr-qa/SKILL.md` §2.2–2.3) for what to look for.

### 4.6 Lint only

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint 9 flat config in `eslint.config.js`. Enforces FSD import
boundaries (`import/no-restricted-paths`), blocks direct Firebase
imports from pages/features, and enforces barrel imports between
features.

## 5 — Dashboard route changes

When adding or modifying `/dashboard/*` routes:

1. Update `src/app/layout/model/dashboardPageMeta.js`.
2. Update `isActive` logic in `src/app/layout/DashboardLayout.jsx` if
   the new route is a child of an existing tab.
3. Add a test case in `scripts/verify-dashboard-meta.mjs`.
4. Run `npm run verify:dashboard-meta`.
5. Consult `docs/DASHBOARD_IA.md` for canonical vocabulary.

## 6 — Architecture quick reference

Strict reduced FSD: `pages` → `features` → `shared` (+ `app` for
shell). Full rules in `.cursorrules`. Key points for agents:

- **Pages** compose feature components; no direct Firebase calls.
- **Features** own `api/` (IO), `model/` (hooks/state), `ui/`
  (presentational). Public surface is `features/<domain>/index.js`.
- **Shared** is domain-agnostic only.
- Cross-feature imports go through public barrels, never deep paths.
- Path alias: `@/` → `src/` (configured in `vite.config.js`).

## 7 — Cloud Functions local dev

```bash
cd functions
npm run serve             # firebase emulators:start --only functions
npm run shell             # firebase functions:shell (REPL)
```

Functions use `firebase-admin` + `firebase-functions` v7. Deploy a
subset with the `deploy:functions:*` script in `package.json`.

## 8 — Common gotchas

- **No Auth emulator for the web app.** The Vite SPA always talks to
  real Firebase Auth. You cannot sign in without a real account.
- **App Check blocks unauthenticated Firestore reads** from unknown
  origins. Register a debug token for localhost (§2).
- **`npm test` exit 134** is a Vitest flake. Re-run once.
- **Vercel previews return 401 to curl.** Agents cannot verify deployed
  previews without user help. Use `npm run build && npm run qa:chunks`
  (localhost) instead.
- **Base branch for PRs is `staging`**, not `main`.
- **`[SKIP-PRD]`** must be the first line of agent-authored GitHub issue
  bodies to prevent the Gemini PM workflow from overwriting them.

## 9 — Keeping this skill current

Update this file whenever you discover:

- A new env var, secret, or config switch that affects local dev.
- A testing trick (e.g. a new QA runner, a mock pattern, a useful
  `vitest` flag) that would save future agents time.
- A new gotcha or failure mode during agent testing.
- Changes to the CI matrix or verification scripts.

**How to update:**

1. Edit this file (`/.cursor/skills/cloud-dev/SKILL.md`).
2. Keep sections numbered and concise — agents scan, not read.
3. Add the date and a one-line summary at the bottom of the relevant
   section so reviewers can see what changed and why.
4. If the discovery is PR-QA specific (browser recipes, chunk-graph
   traps), update `pr-qa/SKILL.md`, `recipes.md`, or `traps.md`
   instead.
