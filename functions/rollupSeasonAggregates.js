 * user doc so `computeUserSeasonStats` can short-circuit to a single point
 * read.
 *
 * Kept separate from `functions/index.js` for the same reason as
 * `poolDelete.js` / `scoringCore.js` / `backfillBustoutsCore.js`: unit
 * testable without spinning up the Functions harness, and reusable from
 * the one-time backfill script.
 *
 * Mirrors `src/shared/utils/showAggregation.js::reduceShowWinners`:
 *   - "winner of the night" uses the global max across every graded,
 *     non-empty pick for the show.
 *   - `max === 0` means nobody wins (empty-pick ties / hollow shows).
 *   - Ties share — every pick whose `score === max` is credited a win.
 *
 * Cannot import the client ESM module directly (functions are CommonJS),
 * so the rule is reimplemented here. Keep both copies aligned.

/**
 * Per-pick rollup decision for the `users.{uid}` materialization pass.

 * `scoreDiff` is the delta to apply to `users.{uid}.totalPoints`:
 *   - **First grade** (`pickData.isGraded !== true`): we add the full
 *     `newScore`. The persisted `pick.score` may already be non-zero
 *     because `recomputeLiveScoresForShow` (live setlist scoring) writes
 *     `score` without flipping `isGraded`. Differencing against that
 *     pre-grade `pick.score` would zero out the contribution and leave
 *     `users.{uid}.totalPoints = 0` while `showsPlayed` keeps
 *     incrementing — the exact symptom seen in #254 follow-up.
 *   - **Re-grade** (`isGraded === true`): we diff against the previously
 *     persisted `pick.score` so re-finalizations are idempotent.
 *
 * `winsDelta` uses the persisted `pick.winCredited` flag to diff against
 * the previous rolled-up state, so re-finalizations never double-count
 * wins even when the global max changes.
