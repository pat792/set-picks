# Auth / Firebase boot practices

Standing rules for marketing, the **auth door** (`/login`), and the app SPA. Learned from Safari hotfix (#850), hard-ready Google (#858), redirect (#859), hop train (#860 / #880 / #881), and the 2026-08-05 recalibration: **HTML-first auth door** is the target — not another CSR hop tier.

**Roadmap / architecture:** `docs/AUTH_SEAMLESS_PATH.md` (**§5 authoritative path** — Phase 2 HTML-first `/login` shipped in v1.54.0).  
**Related:** `docs/OUTBOUND_AUTH_HANDOFF.md` · `docs/API.md` (`/login`). Code today: `login.html` / `loginMain.jsx`, `ensureFirebase.js`, `warmLoginAuthSurface.js`, `prefetchLoginIntent.js`.

## Rules

1. **Marketing `/` stays Firebase-free on cold first paint.** Marketing entry (`index.html` → `marketingMain`). Auth CTAs hard-navigate to `/login`. Do not put `AuthProvider` / `initializeApp` on the marketing critical path. Download-only prefetch of auth-door assets after idle is optional polish (**Phase 3** in path doc) — never execute Auth on marketing first paint.

1b. **Public `/tour-stats*` is marketing too (#853).** Paint chrome from the marketing entry; load App Check + Firestore only inside `fetchPublicTourStats*` (and a parallel page kick). Do not put tour-stats on `app.html` / `AuthProvider`.

2. **Auth door `/login`: form in first HTML; auth-only hydrate (Phase 2 / #892).**  
   - **Today (v1.54.0):** `/login` boots `login.html` with **real form controls** in the first document; `loginMain.jsx` hydrates Auth + form wiring (not `app-*.js` / react-query). Suspense fallback keeps form chrome (anti-#881 blank hang). Session hint and Google redirect return stay eager. Success → hard-navigate to `/setup` or `/dashboard`.  
   - Do **not** reintroduce a skeleton-only / empty-`#root` CSR door as the prod strategy.

2b. **Google CTA must not be enabled until Auth surface is ready (#858).** Disable Continue with Google (brief “Preparing sign-in…” OK) until Auth + click-path modules are ready. Ready click path: `signInWithPopup` / redirect with **no** `await ensureAuthReady()` or dynamic-import on the hot path.

3. **After auth chrome paints: warm Auth immediately** on `/login` (not only `requestIdleCallback`). Prefer `warmPath: 'intent' | 'speculative' | 'immediate'` as today. Prefetch post-auth app chunks only as non-blocking polish — they must not block form paint.

4. **Never await App Check before `signInWithPopup` / email Auth CTAs.** Use `ensureAuthReady()` + fire-and-forget Check on fallback paths. First enabled tap must open the account picker or start redirect.

5. **Await App Check only before Firestore.** Profile/consent/`public_tour_stats` go through `whenFirebaseReady` / `ensureAppCheckNow`.

6. **Safari / iOS / in-app prefer redirect (#859).** Desktop Chromium/Firefox keep popup; `auth/popup-blocked` → one-shot redirect.

7. **WebKit private is the auth-door merge gate.** `scripts/qa/*` is Chromium-only. Auth-door / gesture / boot changes need a human WebKit private check on marketing → `/login` (or closest available WebKit private). Do not claim Safari verified from `qa:*` alone.

## Anti-patterns

| Do not | Why |
|--------|-----|
| `await ensureAppCheckNow()` before `signInWithPopup` | Breaks Safari first-tap (#850) |
| Enable Google while Auth/click modules still downloading | First-tap race (#858) |
| Another CSR hop epic as the auth strategy | Path doc §5 — door construction, not preload tiers |
| Skeleton-only `/login` HTML as “done” for the auth door | Product door requires form in first HTML (Phase 2) |
| `initializeApp` / AuthProvider on marketing as a hop fix | Violates rule 1 |
| Claim “verified on Safari” from `qa:cache` / `qa:chunks` alone | Harness cannot run WebKit |
| Ship auth-door boot changes without WebKit private AC | #881 hang class of failure |

## Quick verify

```bash
# Phase 0 / current: /login form becomes interactive (no indefinite skeleton)
# Google: Preparing… then enables; first tap → redirect (Safari) or popup (desktop Chromium)
# Network: App Check must not gate the Google OAuth request
# Marketing / — no Firebase execute on cold first paint
# Phase 2: View source / first document for /login includes form fields
```
