# Release train - Sprint 9

**Goal:** Ship Sprint 9 as many small PRs into `staging`, then one `staging` -> `main` promote after the train is green.

**Theme:** Stats and personalization: picks heatmap, richer profile averages, public/private tour stats explorer, profile avatars/badges, setlist nerd signals, and comms optimization follow-through.

**Baseline:** `main` and `staging` are aligned at **1.23.0** on 2026-07-16. The train starts from `v1.23.0`; hold all Sprint 9 PRs in `staging` until promote freeze.

**Pattern:** Continuous merges to `staging`, no direct feature PRs to `main`, no `staging` -> `main` promote PR until the train acceptance checklist passes.

## In train vs out of train

### IN - ship in this train

| Issue | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| [#566](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/566) | Docs / product spec | Milestone badge engagement matrix, required before badge implementation |
| [#584](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/584) | Fix | Dedupe venue/location in `tour_rankings_daily` copy |
| [#587](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/587) Phase A | UI fix | Bustout badge on Standings setlist rows without new schema |
| [#553](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/553) | Feature / design spike | Personalized picks heatmap; watch Firestore read cost |
| [#554](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/554) | Feature / spec + UI | Profile averages and song vintage source decision |
| [#567](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/567) | Feature | Selectable avatar set on Profile and public profile |
| [#568](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/568) | Feature | Milestone badge awards and custom badge icons; depends on #566 |
| [#555](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/555) | Feature | Public/private tour stats explorer; likely MINOR if new routes or aggregate docs ship |
| [#587](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/587) Phase B | Feature / schema | Frozen per-song gap/last-played data; MINOR with `docs/API.md` + schema docs |
| [#573](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/573) Phase 0/1 | Comms ops | Optimize playbook + first on-demand pack; draft-only, PM-gated ship |
| [#510](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/510) | Comms feature | Personalized `tour_recap` trigger |
| [#512](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/512) | Comms feature | Follow-up to non-openers; depends on open/click signal clarity |
| [#513](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/513) | Profile / comms feature | Account Preferences hub + Messages inbox-only |

### STRETCH - land on `staging` if capacity; do not block promote

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Follow-up children from #573 | Accepted Optimize recommendations may become new `[SKIP-PRD]` child issues or planned comms rows |
| Backfill tooling for #587 Phase B | Optional if forward-only gap snapshots are enough for promote |

### OUT - explicit defer

| Issue | Why |
|-------|-----|
| [#565](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/565) | Epic remains open until all avatar + badge phases ship; close only if #566/#567/#568 meet epic AC |
| [#300](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/300), [#301](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/301), [#605](https://github.com/pat792/set-picks/issues/605) | Sprint 10 multi-band train |
| Ads backlog (#419-#422) | Not part of stats/personalization train unless a sponsor-slot follow-up is explicitly pulled in |

## Merge order (waves)

Merge each wave to **`staging` only**. Keep PRs small enough to review independently.

```text
Wave 0  Train manifest
        * This manifest
        * Confirm staging/main fast-forward baseline at v1.23.0

Wave 1  Low-risk docs + copy fixes
        * #566 milestone badge matrix
        * #584 tour_rankings_daily venue/location dedupe
        * #587 Phase A bustout badge only, no schema

Wave 2  Profile stats foundation
        * #553 heatmap design spike + first personal stats surface
        * #554 profile averages + song vintage source decision

Wave 3  Profile identity layer
        * #567 avatar picker
        * #568 badge awards/icons after #566 rules are locked

Wave 4  Stats explorer + setlist schema
        * #555 public/private stats explorer
        * #587 Phase B frozen gap / last-played snapshot fields

Wave 5  Comms Optimize and account inbox
        * #573 Phase 0/1 playbook + first on-demand pack
        * #510 tour_recap trigger
        * #512 non-opener follow-up / open-tracking path
        * #513 Account Preferences hub + Messages inbox-only

Wave 6  Promote freeze
        * Staging soak + QA checklist
        * One staging -> main PR
        * Release gate on staging tip
        * Human release tag after promote
```

**Hotfix rule:** If production needs a fix mid-train, branch from `main`, ship the hotfix, then fast-forward or merge `main` back into `staging` before continuing train PRs.

## Versioning for the train

1. Each feature PR follows the repo SemVer rules and may bump `package.json` + `CHANGELOG.md` on `staging`.
2. Docs-only train planning changes do **not** require a version bump.
3. New public routes, Firestore fields, callable surfaces, or env vars require `docs/API.md` updates in the same PR.
4. Expected train promote bump is **MINOR** if #555, #587 Phase B, #510, #512, or #513 ship new public/API surface.
5. On promote day, write one production changelog entry that summarizes the full train.
6. Agents do **not** tag releases; tagging remains a human step after `staging` -> `main`.

## Gates and risk notes

| Area | Gate |
|------|------|
| Dashboard routes/meta | If #555 or #513 adds dashboard routes, update dashboard meta/nav active-state logic, extend `scripts/verify-dashboard-meta.mjs`, and run `npm run verify:dashboard-meta` |
| Firestore reads | #553/#554/#555 must document read-cost budget and prefer rollups/pre-aggregates over unbounded history scans |
| Firestore schema | #587 Phase B must update `docs/OFFICIAL_SETLISTS_SCHEMA.md` and `docs/API.md` |
| Comms delivery | #573/#510/#512 remain PM-gated for merge/deploy; no ad-hoc production sends |
| Dependabot | Existing Dependabot PRs to `staging` are maintenance train cars; merge only when green and do not version-bump those branches |

Incomplete features must land dark, behind absent UX, flags, or forward-only fields rather than blocking staging.

---

## Promote-day checklist

- [ ] All **IN** issues merged to `staging` or explicitly waived here
- [ ] Open Dependabot PRs either merged green or deferred without blocking the train
- [ ] `npm run lint` green on staging tip
- [ ] `npm test` green on staging tip
- [ ] `npm run verify:dashboard-meta` green if route/meta changed
- [ ] `npm run verify:dashboard-ui` green if dashboard UI changed
- [ ] Functions tests green if Functions/comms delivery code changed
- [ ] Firestore rules tests green if rules changed
- [ ] Manual QA checklist captured for profile stats, setlist gap/bustout, stats explorer, and comms preview/canary paths
- [ ] One `staging` -> `main` promote PR opened and merged
- [ ] Human release tag published after promote
- [ ] Sprint 9 epics/issues closed or updated with residual follow-ups

---

## PR hygiene

- Branch: `feat/<issue#>-<kebab-slug>` for issue work; docs/train branches may use `feat/sprint9-release-train`.
- Base: **`staging`**.
- PR bodies include `Closes #<issue>` for issue PRs, plus `## Summary` and `## Test plan`.
- Do not open promote PRs until Wave 6.
- Agents may comment/review when asked, but may not approve, request changes, merge, force-push, or tag without explicit user command.
